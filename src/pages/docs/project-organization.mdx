## Clean Architecture
Instead of making you learn some custom directory structure, Wrapt projects are organized using the well known and maintainable `Clean Architecture` format. If you are not familiar with this structure, 
there are some great resources on it by [Steve Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joNTQy-KXiU), [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and 
[Jason Taylor](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/). 

In short, `Clean Architecture` breaks your project up into logical layers like below. If you want to add something and you're not seeing it here, but think it should be, feel free to 
submit a ticket on github for it to be added.

### Core
The core layer is split into two projects, the `Application` and `Domain` layers. 

The `Domain` project is pretty simple and will capture all of the entities and items directly related to that. This layer should never depend on any other project.

The `Application` project is meant to abstract out our specific business rules for our application. It is dependent on the `Domain` layer, but has no dependencies on 
any other layer or project. This layer defines our interfaces, DTOs, Enums, Exceptions, Mapping Profiles, Validators, Specifications, and Wrappers that can be used by our external layers.


### Infrastructure
Our infrastructure layer is used for all of our external communication requirements (e.g. database communication). For more control, this layer is split into a `Persistence` 
project as well as a `Shared` project. Additional layers like `Auth`, `Web Api Clients`, `File System Accessors`, `Logging Adapters`, and `Email/SMS Sending` can also be added here.

The `Persistence` project will capture our application specific database configuration. The `Shared` project will capture any external service requirements that 
we may need across our infrastructure layer (e.g. DateTimeService).


### API
Finally, we have our API layer. This is where our `WebApi` project will live to provide us access to our API endpoints. This layer depends on both the `Core` and `Infrastructure` layers, 
however, the dependency on `Infrastructure` is only to support dependency injection. Therefore only `Startup` classes should reference `Infrastructure`.

## What Boilerplate Do You Get?
### Entities & DTOs
Entities are set up to represent distinct tables in your database. These entities should not be exposed outside of the API and accordingly each have their own read, create, 
and update data transfer objects (DTOs). 

#### Domain Entities
At some point you may want to make a domain entity that is not directly linked to a database table. You can either do this manually or use the `add:entity` command 
and update the associated files to meet your needs.

### Repositories
Wrapt APIs have a repository built out for each entity that act as the core data access layer (DAL) any time we need to touch the database. You can find the repositories in the 
`Infrastructure.Persistence` layer.

### Filtering and Sorting
#### Toggling Filtering and Sorting
Wrapt APIs use the magnificent [Sieve](https://github.com/Biarity/Sieve) library for filtering and sorting. All GET collection endpoints will have this capability enabled automatically 
and can be used for any attributes that you have this configured for. These properties can be set when creating an entity or 
adding a new property, otherwise you'll need to manage filtering and sorting on existing entity properties manually. There are details in the docs, but all you 
need to to is manage the `Sieve` attribute on any entity properties.

Note that Wrapt APIs do *not* use Sieve's pagination capabilities. For more information on how Wrapt handles pagination, see the [pagination](#pagination) section.

```csharp
[Sieve(CanFilter = true, CanSort = false)]
```

#### Using Filtering and Sorting
To add a filter to your API calls, just add a `Filters` query string and the designated filter values you'd like to use. Below is a few examples, but you can find a full list of 
operators [on the Sieve github page](https://github.com/Biarity/Sieve#operators).

```http
http://localhost:5000/api/staff?Filters=firstname@=*al
http://localhost:5000/api/cities?Filters=name==Atlanta
```

Sorting can also be added using the `SortOrder` query string and passing a comma separated list in the order you'd like to sort by. You can use a preceding `-` to sort as descending.
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/cities?SortOrder=name
http://localhost:5000/api/cities?Filters=name==Atlanta&SortOrder=name
http://localhost:5000/api/cities?Filters=name==Atlanta&SortOrder=name,-popularityscore
```
#### Updating Filtering and Sorting
If you'd like to change the pagination and/or sorting, you can updated the `ENTITYParametersDto`.

### Pagination
Wrapt APIs use a custom pagination capability to make working with large dataset as easy as possible.

#### Pagination Requests
When making a request to your GET collection endpoint, you can pass a `PageNumber` and `PageSize` query string, or exclude them to use the default values. 

To change the default pagination values, go to the `ENTITYParametersDto` class that you'd like to modify and create an override parameter for the property you'd like to change. 
```csharp
public class CityParametersDto : BasePaginationParameters
{
    public override int DefaultPageSize { get; set; } = 50;
    public string Filters { get; set; }
    public string SortOrder { get; set; }
}
```

Please note that if you make change to the `BasePaginationParameters` class, it will affect **all** classes that inherit from it (which is every one by default)

#### Pagination Responses
Getting paginated results is nice, but you'll very likely want to know information about the collection's pagination info as well, especially when you're programming a UI. Wrapt APIs 
will automatically return a complete list of pagination metadata in the response header as `X-Pagination`. The following fields will be returned:

| Metadata        | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TotalCount | The total **record** count for the entire collection. |
| PageSize | The page size **that was requested**. |
| CurrentPageSize | The **current** page size. |
| CurrentStartIndex | The index of the first record on this page. |
| CurrentEndIndex | The index of the last record on this page. |
| PageNumber | The current page number in the collection. |
| TotalPages | The total **page** count for the entire collection. |
| HasPrevious | A boolean that denotes whether or not there is a previous page. |
| HasNext | A boolean that denotes whether or not there is a next page. |


### Fluent Validation
Wrapt APIs are set up to run validation rules on any POST, PUT, and PATCH endpoints using [Fluent Validation](https://fluentvalidation.net/). No rules are added by default, 
but you can add any rules that fit your business needs in `Core.Application.Validation`. Validation rules can be assigned to the `ENTITYForManipulationDtoValidator` class 
if you'd like the rule to be run on both creation (POST calls) and update (PUT, PATCH). If you'd like a rule to just be ran on one or the other, you can add the rule to 
the respective validator class.

The OOTB rules for fluent validation are pretty robust, but if you need to make a custom validation rule, something like 
the below is a good example [(source)](https://www.locktar.nl/programming/net-core/creating-custom-validators-with-fluentvalidation/) .

```csharp
public static class CustomValidators
{
    public static IRuleBuilderOptions<T, string> NotStartWithWhiteSpace<T>(this IRuleBuilder<T, string> ruleBuilder)
    {
        return ruleBuilder
          .Must(m => m != null && !m.StartsWith(" "))
          .WithMessage("'{PropertyName}' should not start with whitespace");
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person>
{
    public PersonValidator()
    {        
        RuleFor(e => e.FirstName)
          .NotEmpty()
          .MaximumLength(30)
          .NotStartWithWhiteSpace();
        RuleFor(e => e.LastName)
          .NotEmpty()
          .MaximumLength(30)
          .NotStartWithWhiteSpace();
    }
}
```
